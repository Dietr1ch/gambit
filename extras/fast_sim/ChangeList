* Fixed the logger
* Added the detector description  fastim_atlas_2d.json - it uses the atlas detector rather than nominal
* Added the pythia8 particle gun example
* Added an analysis script to calculate the resolution from ttree created by the fastsim

* Fixed the segmentation fault caused by the logger. the logger is not a global variable anymore but public variable of fastsim

* Added b-tagging - uses the b-quarks provided by the user 
* Two dimensional efficiency maps
* The pythia fastsim example - compiled through gmake example - now creates a TTree with truth and fastsim particles
* Fixed the MET and now the Truth MET is determined from the weakly interacting particles - saved on the TTree
* Added a logger to allow information, warnings, errors and debug statements to be printed to screen. The debug
statements have different levels of verbosity which can be changed at run time through a command line option
* Pythia example now uses command line options 
   ./example -cmd <pythia8_cmnd_file> -j <detector description json file> -o < root file output> -d < debug level> 

the -d i optional and takes values 0-3
    -h prints out to screen a help statement

* Pythia example and fastsim treat more coherently prompt leptons. 
* Restructered the package 
  Added extra directories 
  pythia8 - which all the cmnd files reside
  detectors - which should contain all the json files describing the detector and its response
* Changed the fastsim_example tag of the makefile to example 
* The code now compliles using -std=c++11 since the logger uses templates
