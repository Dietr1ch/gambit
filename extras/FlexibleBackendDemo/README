Not everyone was convinced with my last demo, so I decided to improve it. 
     Please focus on the demoKinematicsCalculator.cpp file. It shows 
     the true power of all those macros I wrote. If you are worried about how 
     complicated those macros are, don't be worried; neither the collaboration 
     members nor the users will ever have to modify them once we have them 
     finalized. Also, I have included a lot more comments for your viewing 
     pleasure. ---Abram 

To compile: g++ -I. demoKinematicsCalculator.cpp

Then execute: ./a.out
