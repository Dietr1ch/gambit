Pythia test instructions:
-------------------------

To set up a simple BOSS test environment using Pythia 8.186 as example, do:

1. Copy the Pythia source to two directories, pythia8186/ and pythia8186_original/
   (All paths relative to the boss/ main directory.)

2. In modules/cfg.py, add "pythia8186" and "pythia8186_original" to the list 'accepted_paths'

3. Run gccxml:  gccxml -Ipythia8186_original/include pythia8186_original/include/Pythia8/Pythia.h -fxml=pythia.xml

4. Run BOSS:  ./boss.py pythia.xml 
   (The default output directory is output/. This can be set in modules/cfg.py)
   
5. To copy the generated code to the pythia8186 directory, run ./update_pythia.sh

6. Go to pythia8186/ and build pythia the usual way, but make sure to enable shared libs:
     ./configure --enable-shared
     ./make

7. To copy BOSS-generated code over to the test directory, run ./update_testrun_pythia.sh'
   This will also copy pythia8186/libs/libpythia8.so to testrun_pythia/

8. Go to testrun_pythia/loader and compile a test program. The one currently working with factory functions
   is 'main03_remake_with_factories.cpp':  g++ main03_remake_with_factories.cpp -ldl

9. Run it. If it fails, check that all library symbols are set correctly in main03_remake_with_factories.cpp.
