Here we add things to do for the DS6 implementation in gambit.


1. make copy of standalones (for testing)
   Here: change explcitly to DS6 versions

2. cp DarkSUSY_5_1_3.hpp -> 6_0
(comment out everything but init, then comment in one by one)

0. "Every backend can only provide one library" -> needs to be sorted out / discussed!

3. cp DarkSUSY_5_1_3.cpp -> 6_0 (frontend)

3. for each replaced function(ality) DS5->DS6, change/update:
   - DarkBit_rollcall.hpp (always, unless same capability is same)
   - src/.cpp files (if implementation / call changes)
   - types/DarkSUSY.hpp (version ??)


relevant TEST programs: 
DarkBit_XXX_standalone -> modifiy by commenting out + replace ini
