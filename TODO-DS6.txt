Here we add things to do for the DS6 implementation in gambit.
General: we decided to have one DS6 backend per model, like 
for micrOMEGAs.

1. extend cmake/backends.cmake along the same lines as for mO;
   start with just the MSSM module
   DONE [JE]. Added DarkSUSY 6.1.1 as a base and then added
   models. Currently all models in DS 6.1.1 have their separate models
   in the cmake system, along the same lines as for mO.

2. cp include/gambit/Backends/frontends/DarkSUSY_5_1_3.hpp  -> 6_0;
   again one for each module, start with MSSM 
   (comment out everything but init, then comment in one by one)

3. cp src/frontends/DarkSUSY_5_1_3.cpp -> 6_0;
   again one for each module, start with MSSM 

4. for each replaced function(ality) DS5->DS6, change/update:
   - DarkBit_rollcall.hpp (always, unless some capability is same)
   - src/.cpp files (if implementation / call changes)
   - include/gambit/Backends/backend_types/DarkSUSY.hpp (version ??)

5. make copy of standalones (for testing)
   Here: change explicitly to DS6 versions
   relevant TEST programs: 
   DarkBit_XXX_standalone -> modify by commenting out + replace ini
