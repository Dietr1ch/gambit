* large difference DS5/DS6 for funnel models
  -> sv to quarks
  -> running ?
   NLOoption = off: <sigma v> [cm^3/s] --   DS6: 6.17142e-28
   NLOoption = default: <sigma v> [cm^3/s] --  DS6: 6.53436e-28
  -> JE/TB: add option NLOoption = 'DS5! -> DS 6.2.3.

* DS5 standalone: neutrino routines sometimes hang...
  -> mail to Pat: nulike ?

* [Jonathan] IC, sv, DSphs from mO ?

* [Jonathan] Silveira-Zee standalone + yaml file

* [Anders] CMSSM.yaml
 
* [Torsten] rename _DS6 -> standard; standard -> _DS5
   (as well as darksusy -> darksusy5)
  [mostly done, still to be tested on *all* standalones]


* update to 6.2.2
   - [Torsten] grep FIXME in MSSM frontend! (also in DarkSUSY.hpp)

* get rid of prelim. standalones

* add new relic density feature (maybe only after merging to trunk !)

[done]

[*] neutrinos completely wrong !?

[*] DS6 WIMP standalone !

[*] tidy up cmake etc: we *only* want DS6 MSSM + generic WIMP!
  - different make target darksusy_MSSM vs darksusy_MSSM_6.1.1 ?

[*] MSSM frontend 6.2.2

[*] DarkBit_standalone_MSSM_all_backends

[*] backended generic_WIMP6.2.2 + updated standalone
