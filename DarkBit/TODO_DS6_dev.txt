* [Jonathan] IC, sv, DSphs from mO ?

* [Jonathan] Silveira-Zee standalone + yaml file

* get rid of prelim. standalones
  (DarkBit_standalone_MSSM_DS5, DarkBit_standalone_MSSM_DS6, 
   DarkBit_standalone_MSSM,DarkBit_standalone_WIMP),
  then rename remaining ones
  [Anders: all the MSSM ones are done] 

--------
[done]
-------

[*] revert name change in cmake system: "darksusy5" --> "darksusy"

[*] neutrino routines sometimes hang -> nulike 1.0.9

[*] indirect detection routines work:
    - output files with fluxes look good
    - Fermi and IceCube likelihoods now look reasonable 
      (after adding missing RD_fraction_one.reset_and_calculate)

[*] CMSSM.yaml

[*] neutrinos completely wrong !?

[*] DS6 WIMP standalone !

[*] tidy up cmake etc: we *only* want DS6 MSSM + generic WIMP!
  - different make target darksusy_MSSM vs darksusy_MSSM_6.1.1 ?

[*] MSSM frontend 6.2.2

[*] DarkBit_standalone_MSSM_all_backends

[*] backended generic_WIMP6.2.2 + updated standalone   

[*] rename _DS6 -> standard; standard -> _DS5
   (as well as darksusy -> darksusy5)


[*] large difference DS5/DS6 for funnel models (sigma v to quarks)
    conclusion: this is (most likely) *not* a problem with the running,
    but rather an issue with a wrong way of setting up DS 6.1 in gambit
    [DarkSUSY_MSSM_6_1_1.cpp, see comment before call to dsorder_flavour()]
    DS_6.2.2 gives almost identical results for sigma v and Oh2 as DS_5. 


[*] add new relic density feature   
    -> included in 6.2.2, but without timing. Will be added to DS 6.2.3.
