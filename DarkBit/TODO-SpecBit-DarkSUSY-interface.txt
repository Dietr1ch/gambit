Needed things from SpecBit to interface to DarkSUSY

1. Validation routine that gives them MSSM-25 input parameters to DarkSUSY
and uses the DarkSUSY spectrum calculator. Not be be used for real
calculations, but useful for testing and validation. Joakim implements.

2. A routine in GAMBIT that transfers what is needed to DarkSUSY. The goal
is to completely avoid using the DS spectrum calculator (i.e. not like in
the current SLHA reader where one cannot know what is exactly in the file
and then calculate stuff anyway just to be sure we have what is needed).

What is needed is:

* SM parameters (SLHA convention)
* All sparticle masses
* All squark and slepton mixing matrices
* CKM mixing
* mu parameter
* Neutralino and chargino mixing matrices, beware of convention
* yukawas
* particle widths
* decay information for Higgses (to not have to call dshigwid)

Open questions
* Do we need M1, M2, M3, mass2q etc? We shouldn't really.

What DS should do:
* Calculate sin^2 theta_W at Z scale at tree level (to have consistent tree
  level annihilation cross sections)
* set modeltype flag correctly
* calculate vertices
