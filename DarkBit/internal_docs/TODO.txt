NEW TODO list
2016-07-12 (CW)


DarkBit
=======

Do:
- Clean up header and src files from old mess
- Make sure that halo model is used consistently between nuLike, gamLike and 
  DDCalc (Christoph)
- Check whether DD calculations require decay information from ProcessCatalog
- Remove RDeffannrateDSprep (Torsten)
- Move micromegas installation routines into the cmake system
- Ensure that masses in DS and Gambit are used consistently (Introduce 
  compile-time removal of error messages for DS lib)
- Check that masses given to DD calc are always positive (Chris mail from 28 May)
- Check content of SloopyDarkBit.cpp
- Switch off kinematical warnings for IB routines in DarkSUSY (as discussed with Torsten)
- Start adding descriptions to the capability database
- Mention all options in the darkbit paper
- Update valid energy ranges in SimYieldTables (GamYields.cpp)
- Check t tbar final single states in GamYields.cpp
- Add getValue docs for SimpleLikelihoods.cpp, SunNeutrinos.cpp, MSSM.cpp, SingletDM.cpp, ...
- Decide what to do with quark final states in cascade code (Cascades.cpp:61)
- Double-check sampling in cascade code
- Think about convergence criterion in cascade code
- Double-check SingletDM expression
- Go through RelicDensity FIXME items via skype with Torsten (see file)
- Go through diskless init problems via skype with Joakim (see file)
- Update SunNeutrinos.cpp once BF become available from ProcessCatalog
- DarkMatterID should come from MSSM_spectrum -- MSSM.cpp
- gambit_SingletDM_hdf5_bad_process_catalog.yaml :  Delete or keep?
- Make decision about default speeds for RD in DS
- Joakim to check 333 of DarkSUSY.cpp, maybe cause for current problems with 
  SLHA initialization?
- Check FIXME in Cascades.cpp, decay_chain.cpp

Later:
- SunNeutrinos.cpp: change below to >= when version numbers are available as 
  ints
- Check directly nested integral bug DarkBit.cpp:200 (37bf52e9f79a)
- Implement filter module for masses from Spectrum object to masses used in 
  DarkBit
- Split GamYield in cascade and tabulated parts, to allow dynamic stopping
  conditions for the cascade codes
- Remove dependency on mwimp capability everywhere
- Implement Higgs yields
- Test Nazlias `DarkBit_SuperIsoRelic` routines (mail from 14-07-2015)
- Backend PPPC yields table (inclusive Higgs yields)
- CMB likelihoods
- Implement gamma-ray line limits (HESS-II, Fermi)


Paper
=====

Do:
- More details on FCMC:DecayTable object in paper


SingletDM
=========

Later:
- Use singlet scalar spectrum object (which is not existing up to now)


Core
====

Do:
- Understand why the timing system does not work properly for parallel codes 
  (looping)

Later/maybe:
- Dependencies of loop-manager managed functions to be added to loop-manager
  loop should only run after *all* relevant parent functors have been evaluated
- Implement function > module rules
- Check out FIXME statements in funktions.hpp again and resolve SegFault issues
- Avoid minimal loops in the dep-resolver / cyclic dependency fix
- Documentation for BaseFunctions
- Set backend versions globally in YAML file as of Pats mail from 21-12-15
- Specify only function name in ObsLike section
- Think about "!ignore" flag for debug purposes
- Implement printing of stand-alone code in core
