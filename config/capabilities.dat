# GAMBIT central capabilities description database
#
# GAMBIT will parse this file and try to match the entries 
# to the capabilities it has registered. If there are any 
# conflicts it will report them, and if any capabilities
# are lacking descriptions those will be reported too.
# This is then merged with internally known information
# to create a centralised database of capability
# information.
# This is found in the file "<insert name here>"
#
# Note: Yaml syntax for multi-line strings is this:
#
#body: |
#  This is a multi-line string.
#  "special" metacharacters may
#  appear here. The extent of this string is
#  indicated by indentation.

# We can break this into categories however we want; yaml will just ignore comments

#-------------------------------------
#  Test capabilities
#-------------------------------------

test_vector: |
   Some kind of vector or something

vSigma: |
   Probably a cross-section of some kind
   Lets add an extra line to demo multiline descriptions

#-------------------------------------
#  Fake particle capabilities
#-------------------------------------

widths: |
   The width of some particle or other

xsection: |        
   Another mystery cross-section

#####  SingletDM  #####

SingletDM_spectrum: |
    Create spectrum object for scalar singlet dark matter model, available functions
    are a simple container spectrum and one produced by a spectrum generator

check_perturb: |
    Compute the spectrum with the spectrum generator and return a
    likelihood corresponding to the validity of the spectrum up to the chosen high scale.

vacuum_stability: |
    Run the quartic Higgs coupling to high scales, in order to determine
    the expected lifetime of the electroweak vacuum, the instability scale, and
    the perturbativity of the couplings up to the necessary scale.


check_perturb_min_lambda: |
    Check that dimensionless couplings are sufficiently small up to the smaller
    of the Planck scale and the scale at which the quartic Higgs coupling is
    minimised and non-positive.

VS_likelihood: |
    Compute likelihood of no electroweak vacuum decays in the past light cone.

expected_lifetime: |
    Return the expected lifetime of the electroweak vacuum.

print_SingletDM_spectrum: |
    Print the spectrum contents to the output stream.

#####   Standard model  #####

SMINPUTS: |
    Provide Standard Model parameters in SLHA2 input conventions.

qedqcd_subspectrum: |
    Create QedQcdWrapper version of Spectrum* from SMInputs structs.

SM_spectrum: |
    Create Spectrum object from SMInputs structs and SM Higgs parameters.


#####   MSSM  #####


unimproved_MSSM_spectrum: |
    Returns unimproved MSSM spectrum object calculated with boundary conditions
    depedent on the choice of function used.

SM_subspectrum: |
    Return the standard model subspectrum object from the MSSM_spectrum

FH_MSSMMasses: |
    SUSY masses and mixings, as computed by FeynHiggs.

prec_HiggsMasses: |
    Higgs masses and mixings with theoretical uncertainties, as computed by FeynHiggs.

Higgs_Couplings: |
    Higgs couplings, as computed by FeynHiggs

MSSM_spectrum: |
    Provide an updated MSSM spectrum from the unimproved version with
    precision W and Higgs masses.
