# This is then merged with internally known information

MSSM25: |
   25 parameter phenomenological MSSM (plus input scale, for 26 parameters)
   Following the conventions for the MSSM soft breaking terms in Baer and Tata (2006): the off- diagonal terms in the squark and slepton matrices as well as the trilinear coupling matrices a_ij are set to zero. As well, the first and second generation terms in these matrices are set to zero, leaving only the third generation trilinear couplings a_t, a_b, a_tau. In explicit models of SUSY breaking it often occurs that these trilinear couplings are proportional to the corresponding Yukawa couplings, so the parameterisation a_i = y_i*A_i is often used; this is also the SLHA convention (Skands et al., 2004), so below the A_i are our parameters. The c_ij trilinear couplings are all set to zero, and the CP-violating gaugino masses M1′, M2′, M3′ are set to zero. These drastic simplifications leave one with the following parameters:
   
   M_input        - Input scale (i.e. SUSY breaking scale)
   M1,M2,M3       - Soft gaugino masses
   At,Ab,Atau     - Trilinear couplings 
   mHu2,mHd2      - Up and down type soft Higgs masses squared
   mu             - Superpotential mu (Higgs bilinear) parameter
   tanb           - Ratio of Higgs VEVs, tan_\beta
   meL,mmuL,mtauL,   
   meR,mmuR,mtauR - Soft slepton masses
   mq1L,mq2L,mq3L,
   muR,mcR,mtR,
   mdR,msR,mbR,   - Soft squark masses
   
   (Just for demo; I forget exactly what the SLHA conventions are)
