QEWSB specifies the scale at which the electroweak symmetry-breaking (EWSB) consistency condition that the Higgs potential possess a tree-level minimum is imposed. This model is intended for use in situations where the Higgs potential is run to different scales, e.g. for calculating pole masses or investigating vacuum stability.

   a local dark matter density rho0, and a local Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution.

   from the local dark matter density rho0 and the other parameters of the density profile.

   Same as Halo_Einasto, but instead of giving rho0 explicitly as a parameter, it is derived
   from the scale density rhos and the other parameters of the density profile.

Halo_gNFW: |
   Dark matter halo model corresponding to a generalized NFW density profile with scale density rhos,

StandardModel_Higgs: |

   Simple Higgs model containing the SM tree-level Higgs mass mH as the only parameter, which is interpreted as the pole mass by most calculations. This generally removes the need to calculate it via renormalisation group running in any higher-energy theory. When observables are to be calculated that genuinely need to use running parameters, the model point is up-translated to a parameter point in the StandardModel_Higgs_running (the parent model), where mH^2 at scale mZ is set equal to the square of the tree-level mass, and QEWSB is set to the top mass. This is useful for more detailed calculations involving module functions that explicitly require the running mass parameter of StandardModel_Higgs_running, and/or functions that need accurate pole masses calculated by including the Higgs sector in renormalisation calculations.
