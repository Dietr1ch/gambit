# GAMBIT central scanner location database

# Cmake will parse this file and use it to locate
# scanner libraries before writing makefiles
# that link to them.
#
# Paths can be given as full absolute paths, or
# relative to the main GAMBIT directory.  Paths
# starting with a backslash will be interpreted as
# absolute, those beginning with a period will
# be interpreted as relative to the GAMBIT dir.
