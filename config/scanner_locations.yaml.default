# Cmake will parse this file and use it to locate
# scanner libraries before writing makefiles
# that link to them.
#
# Paths can be given as full absolute paths, or 
# relative to the main GAMBIT directory.  Paths 
# starting with a backslash will be interpreted as 
# absolute, those beginning with a period will
# be interpreted as relative to the GAMBIT dir.
