Getting serious about including astroparticle data in global fits to new physics scenarios

Searches for physics beyond the standard model come in many forms, from terrestrial probes to astroparticle experiments and cosmological observations.  Efforts to combine multiple search channels in 'global fits' to new physics scenarios typically consider only a subset of the available channels.  Astroparticle searches in particular are only included in a very approximate way, if at all.  In this talk I will review recent progress in including detailed gamma-ray, neutrino and CMB searches for dark matter in global fits.  I will also preview some of the future developments and challenges in this field, where the applicability of global fits will move well beyond the small range of constrained supersymmetric models that they have so far mostly been applied to.
