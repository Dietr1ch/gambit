Towards Next Generation Global Fits Including LHC Simulations

In spite of all of our expectations, both theoretically and observationally,
that the Standard Model of particle physics is incomplete, we have yet to have
discovered any new particles beyond the Standard Model (BSM). A recent methodology
for studying such BSMs is via global fits and statistical inferencing.
Using global fits, one can see the viable remaining parameter space of a given
BSM. However, current global fit tools and frameworks may not be general
enough for general BSMs. It is time for a new generation of global fitting
tools which can handle any BSM as well as properly include even complicated
and/or slow likelihoods, such as those from LHC observations.


Notes:

- Is this correct? ... Yes.
  For strong production, NLO cross sections should be larger than LO cross
  sections. Thus, with a proper cross section calculation, we would get more
  events, which would then make our points more excluded. Thus, using only 
  the LO cross sections is in any case conservative wrt exclusion.
  For weak production, my understanding is that the cross section calculators
  don't really exist.
