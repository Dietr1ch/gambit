\subsection*{Part 2: Details}

\textbf{PROSPECTS} (PROblems in Statistical Parameter Estimation and ConsTraints for Supersymmetry) Conference 2010 -- this conference brought together experts from every major group involved in SUSY global fits for the first time, to discuss methods, results and future plans.  I co-headed the organization together with Are Raklev.  A number of new papers and collaborations arose from the conference, and feedback from participants was overwhelmingly positive. I was personally able to meet and discuss my work and scientific opinions with all the leaders of the field, and firmly establish myself amongst them.

\textbf{PHYS606: Practical Numerical Methods in Physics} -- I suggested, designed, lectured, graded and organized this course from scratch in the Winter Semester of 2011.  The course gave graduate and advanced undergraduate students a solid practical background in the numerical methods required for doing everyday research in many areas of physics.  It focused on understanding how to implement and effectively use the methods; assignments involved developing a personal library of numerical routines that students could use in their future research, as well as a seminar on an advanced topic.  Part of my motivation for teaching the course was to find students interested in working on related projects with me, and endow them with the necessary skills for such collaborations.  I have just begun supervising two of the students in exactly these projects (Wei Xue and Elinore Roebber), with one (Elinore) already having contributed some calculations to a paper that we recently had accepted at ApJ [1].  Teaching evaluations were stellar, and demand is strong for the course to run again.

\textbf{McGill Astroparticle Seminar Series} -- this biweekly series of seminars by invited experts aims to foster an increased level of discussion and sense of shared community between the astro, hep-th and hep-ex groups at McGill, in line with the strategic aims of this fellowship proposal.  This series has basic funding approval and will begin in January 2012; some small amount of the Banting funds will go toward funding additional speakers.
