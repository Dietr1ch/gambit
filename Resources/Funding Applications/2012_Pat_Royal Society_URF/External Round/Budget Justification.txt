Travel:
---------
The highly internationalised nature of astroparticle physics, and the extremely
interdisciplinary nature of the research program I propose will require extensive
international travel, to present at conferences, attend Collaboration Meetings (both
experimental and theoretical) and undertake direct visits to my collaborators'
institutes. I will also need to host similar visits by collaborators to Imperial
(although these costs are listed under 'Other Expenses').

For years 2-5, I have allocated GBP4500 for my own international travel,
corresponding to approximately two intercontinental trips and two continental
European trips. I have also allocated GBP1000 for internal UK travel, which will
cover two domestic trips per year.

In year 1, I have allocated a further GBP1000 for international travel, to cover a 
brief return visit to Montreal to provide in-person supervisory and collaboratory 
support to students that do not accompany me in relocating from McGill.

Equipment:
----------------
Year 1: A new high-end laptop and peripherals (screen, keyboard, mouse;
GBP2500) and corresponding enterprise-level desktop server (GBP3700) for
developing and managing parallel global fit code.
Year 2: Laptops for two starting PhD students (GBP3000)
Year 3: none
Year 4: Replacement laptop and peripherals (GBP2500)
Year 5: Replacement server (GBP3700)

Other Expenses:
-----------------------
All years: Annual GitHub (or similar) hosting fees for global fit and related code
repositories (GBP300 p.a.)
Year 2: Funding for visiting collaborators / students (GBP2200 = 1 intercontinental
+ 2 UK/continental guests)
Year 3: Funding to host a small meeting/workshop on global fits (GBP4000)
Funding for visiting collaborators / students (GBP1200 = 1 intercont. or 2
UK/cont. guests)
Year 4: Funding for visiting collaborators / students (GBP2700 = 2 intercont. + 1
UK/cont.)
Year 5: Funding for visiting collaborators / students (GBP1500 = 1 intercont. + 1
UK/cont.)
