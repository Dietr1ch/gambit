Two questions dominate large parts of modern astroparticle physics: What is dark matter, and what is the nature of physics at the TeV scale?  Dark matter accounts for approximately 80% of the matter budget of the Universe, yet its identity is unknown.  Many theories for physics beyond the standard model of particle physics (BSM - beyond the SM), such as supersymmetry (SUSY), extra dimensions and phenomenological descriptions of weakly-interacting massive particles, involve a fundamental link between dark matter and the TeV scale.  With the spectacular recent success of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), particularly in uncovering the Higgs boson, and the construction of high-energy astrophysical experiments such as Fermi, IceCube and XENON, astroparticle physics is arriving at the TeV scale; the time to put these disparate pieces together into a cohesive and unified understanding of dark matter and TeV-scale physics is now.

Goals:
- Identify the correct theory behind dark matter and TeV-scale BSM physics
- Exclude large classes of other viable and popular dark matter and TeV-scale BSM theories
- Distinguish between areas of parameter space giving rise to distinct astroparticle phenomena within single BSM theories

Here I outline a cutting-edge 'global fit' research program designed to test a broad range of dark matter and BSM theories against a similarly large range of experimental datasets, with each theory to be simultaneously compared with every available dataset.  The goal is to either uncover the identity of dark matter and carefully characterise it, or rule out and strongly constrain different BSM theories, drawing strongly on the synergies that exist between different experiments.  This program of holistic analysis will result in far more complete and robust comparisons between experimental data and dark matter/BSM models than presently exists in the literature.  My unique experience in bringing together theoretical, experimental and statistical techniques, as well as astronomical and particle perspectives, will be essential in the success of this endeavour.

I will employ as complete a set of experimental observables as possible (data from the LHC, Fermi, HESS, IceCube, PAMELA, XENON, CDMS, LUX and others), and consider a much broader range of dark matter and BSM models than have been subjected to such rigorous analysis to date (phenomenological and SUSY-breaking versions of the minimal supersymmetric SM, universal extra-dimensional, Two Higgs Doublet and effective dark matter models like Isospin-violating, Inelastic and Exciting Dark Matter).  A crucial component of this project will be the development of a highly flexible 'second-generation' BSM global-fitting code, capable of operating at a degree of computational abstraction that would allow for very fast implementation of future models and datasets.

The research in this proposal will revolutionise the emerging field of BSM global fits, by producing rigorous global analyses of a vast number of BSM theories, and providing essential tools for the explosion it will undergo in the coming years.
