Applied for Leadership Fellow grant at Glasgow, starting 1st July 2013: SUCCESSFUL

Award includes £82k for a PDRA starting April 2014: work to be split between
Rivet & GAMBIT or Rivet & ATLAS, depending on candidates.

Also includes £15k for computing time / equipment.

Separately (but I may as well record it here), my Royal Society URF grant
includes £4k/year for equipment: after subtraction of personal laptop upgrades
etc. there is probably O(£3k)/yr which could be spent on compute resources for
GAMBIT.
