\centerline{\textbf{STFC ERF: Pathways to Impact}}\bigskip 

Whilst searches for particle physics beyond the standard model and astroparticle phenomena are about as `blue sky' as research comes, I see two potential pathways to impact outside my own academic community:
\begin{itemize}
\item Global fits are useful not only for determining the impacts of existing experiments, but for quantitatively comparing the prospective impacts of different proposed experiments and their potential configurations.  The results of these comparisons are of direct usefulness for informing upcoming policy decisions by bodies such as STFC itself.  I plan to submit such evaluations to the STFC Science Committee where appropriate, and may become involved in the Committee myself at the end of the ERF.
\item My differential evolution optimisation code will have some additional features that may make it a commercialisable code package, useful in e.g. finance and engineering.  I will explore this possibility with Imperial Innovations, ICL's technology transfer office.
\end{itemize}
