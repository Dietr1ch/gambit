\centerline{\textbf{STFC ERF: Public engagement}}\bigskip 

I have been involved in a number of outreach activities: I wrote an article on `dark stars' for the Swedish amateur astronomy magazine \textit{Popul\"ar Astronomi}, and gave an interview on the same topic for an article in \textit{New Scientist}.  I arranged a public lecture by John Ellis following the PROSPECTS Workshop that I organised in 2010, and have volunteered at various public open days and science festivals over the years. 

The Imperial Astrophysics Group has a strong history of innovative outreach activities, and I fully intend to contribute to these both as an organiser and public presenter.  I hope to develop an interactive, computer-based exposition of the roles and impacts of different experiments around the world in the hunt for new physics, based on the results of my global fits.  This could probably be arranged as a research project for a group of first or second-year undergraduates, and might appear in a science museum, on an Imperial webpage, and/or taken on tour to e.g. schools in disadvantaged areas to promote enthusiasm for physics.  I plan to apply for an STFC Public Engagement Small Award to help make this activity a reality.
