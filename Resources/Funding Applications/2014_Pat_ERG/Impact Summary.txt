Apart from academics within astrophysics and particle physics, there are three groups that have the potential to benefit from the research in this grant:

1. Workers and firms in other quantitative fields
------
In the course of developing GAMBIT, I will create a number of novel scanning and optimisation software packages, extend existing optimisation methods, and develop new data-mining strategies.  These new computational techniques will be useful to workers in quantitative sectors such as finance, engineering and information technology, who are required to solve optimisation problems and/or extract meaningful conclusions from so-called 'Big Data' on a regular basis.  Some examples might include:
 - A stockbroker modelling billions of share-price movements, needing to find the best-fit parameters of a market model in order to maximise his/her trading returns,
 - An engineer designing an infrastructure project like a transport network, trying to maximise the overall cost-benefit ratio of the project whilst simultaneously fulfilling a number of complicated external design constraints, or
 - A software engineer designing an application like Google Maps to find the fastest route from Point A to Point B.

2. Policy Makers and Research Councils
-----
The GAMBIT Project will not only determine the current state of agreement between different theories and all current data, but will also quantify how effectively proposed experiments can probe theories of new physics.  This will provide a means of quantifying and comparing the expected performance of new experimental proposals.  Given that policy makers and Research Councils must decide which future experiments to fund, this information will provide them an additional concrete means by which to rank different scientific proposals against each other.

3. The general public
-----
The general public has an enduring interest in astrophysics, cosmology and the latest energy frontier in the search for new particles.  In providing funding for a PDRA and Project Student on GAMBIT, this grant will give the UK public two more young, enthusiastic, communicative scientists to take part in the extensive public outreach program of my ERF.  That program involves developing an interactive computer program to be used by school children in connection with school visits carried out by the Imperial College Astrophysics group; see the Pathways to Impact document and p 17 of the attached copy of my 2012 ERF application for more details.  This will increase enthusiasm for physics amongst the young, and (one hopes) ultimately help increase tertiary enrolments in science and technology subjects.

At a more abstract level, this grant will provide a public benefit by concretely increasing the sum total of human knowledge about the most fundamental physical laws governing the behaviour of our Universe.  By characterising Higgs physics in the most complete and detailed way possible, I will increase this understanding significantly, regardless of whether deviations from the Standard Model prediction for the Higgs are observed or not.
