            Jack to add gluino-mediated third generation search (3b + 0 or 1 lepton). (Jack)
            High res ATLAS limit debug plot (Martin)
            Authors to add institute information (all)
            Authors to add any financial acknowledgements required (all)
            Check discussion of --fast-math flag (Martin)
    Code to do
            Add DELPHES instructions (commented out) to gambit_Collider_CMSSM.yaml (Abram)
            Test and cleanup the doxygen comments in the code (Abram).
            SpecializablePythia::init_external seems poorly named. Rename it somehow, and then remove the @todo's in the doxygen comments (Abram)

MEDIUM TERM

1. Work out how to put resonance likelihoods into the current code structure (Andy)

2. Implement resonance likelihoods (Martin, Andy, Chris R + Felix code)

3. Implement the new capability design (Anders, Martin, Andy, Pat?)

4. Need to add a meson level event for potential Belle II simulation, plus implement Belle II simulation (Florian + volunteers)

5. Improve HiggsSignals signal strength treatment (Chris R, James)

How to valgrind to find ColliderBit memory issues:
valgrind --tool=memcheck --memcheck:leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes --suppressions=valgrindColliderBit.supp ./gambit -f gambit_Collider.yaml
