Introducing DarkBit, main features (flexible and efficient interface; more realistic likelihoods
than typically implemented; further new features?). 
Some examples for illustration...

\section{Introduction {\bf [TB/AP]}}
\label{intro}

\begin{itemize}
\item intro to physics
\item outline scope of DarkBit; relations to backends \& genuinely new aspects
\item relation to GAMBIT
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Physics framework}
\label{phys}

$\to$ Here, we briefly describe the background necessary to understand what the code modules do...

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Relic density {\bf [JE]}}
\label{phys_rd}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Direct detection {\bf [CS]}}
\label{phys_dd}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Indirect detection {\bf [TB]}}
\label{phys_id}

$\to$ general physics \& concepts; specifics go to next two subsections 
(including descriptions of respective likelihood)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Indirect detection with gamma rays {\bf [CW]}}
\label{phys_ga}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Indirect detection with neutrinos {\bf [PS/JE]}}
\label{phys_nu}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Module description}
\label{code}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{General code framework {\bf [CW]}}
\label{code_gen}

$\to$ connection to GAMBIT(?), introduce concept of backends, setup and initialization of particle models

\medskip
\noindent
$\to$ briefly describe which backends are used, and what they contribute 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Relic density {\bf [JE/TB]}}
\label{code_rd}
\begin{itemize}
\item two possibilities: $W_\mathrm{eff}$ directly from DS or built from process catalogue (as introduced below)
\item...
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Direct detection {\bf [CS]}}
\label{code_dd}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Indirect detection {\bf [CW/TB]}}
\label{code_id}

$\to$ general physics \& concepts; specifics go to next two subsections
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe process catalogue 
\item Different final states: "basic" 2-body vs. cascade {\bf [LD]} vs higher-order corrections
\item...
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Indirect detection with gamma rays {\bf [CS]}}
\label{code_ga}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Indirect detection with neutrinos {\bf [PS]}}
\label{code_nu}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Validation \& examples}
\label{examples}

A few nice \& simple physics applications; to be discussed and worked out...

E.g.
\begin{itemize}
\item effective WIMP
\item comparison between GC and dwarf likelihoods
\item Differences between mO and DS: relic density, DD couplings, maybe spectra... {\bf [JE/JC]}
\item spectra comparison: Cascade code vs. other codes and/or analytical spectra  {\bf [LD/MP]}
\item Results for MSSM (and/or Singlet DM) benchmark points
\item  ...
\end{itemize}
