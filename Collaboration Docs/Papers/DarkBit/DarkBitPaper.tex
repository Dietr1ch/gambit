Introducing \DB, physics motivation, main features (flexible and efficient interface; more realistic likelihoods
than typically implemented; further new features?). Mention link to \GB\ but emphasize standalone character. 
List examples for illustration...

\section{Introduction [TB/AP/XXX]}
\label{intro}

\begin{itemize}
\item intro to physics: DM and WIMPs; motivation, production + detection methods
\item outline scope of \DB; relations to backends \& genuinely new aspects
\item relation to \GB
\end{itemize}

This article is organized as follows. In Section \ref{phys} we  briefly introduce the general physics 
context and the main  observables to be calculated, before describing in Section \ref{code} the corresponding 
implementation details for the various modules of \DB. Validation tests and illustrative examples of typical
\DB\ usage are presented in Section \ref{examples}. We continue with an outlook on planned code expansions 
with future releases in Section \ref{out}, and conclude in Section \ref{conc}. In \ref{code_init} we provide a quick 
guide for how to install \DB\ and get started with a simple test example.

\section{Validation and  Examples}
\label{examples}

In this Section we present a few selected  examples that illustrate scope and
potential applications of \DB. At the same time, these examples serve as validation
tests of the code.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Setting up an effective WIMP model {\bf [XXX]}}

$\to$ Briefly describe what we did in Geilo, and maybe reproduce Fig.5 in 1204.3622

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Comparing {\sf DarkSUSY} and {\sf micrOMEGAs} {\bf [JE/JC]}}

\DB\ offers the unique possibility to easily compare different numerical codes for the computation of DM properties
in a well-defined and consistent way. Here, we focus for illustration on the most widely used packages, {\sf DarkSUSY} 
\cite{xxx} and {\sf micrOMEGAs} \cite{xxx}. We stress, however, that it is straightforward for users to 
perform similar comparisons for essentially any other numerical code, simply by adding it as a backend to \DB.

\medskip
$\to$ focus on relic density, DD couplings, maybe spectra

\medskip
...


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Gamma-ray spectra from cascade decays {\bf [LD/MP]}}

One of the main new features of this first \DB\ release is a novel way of calculating the cosmic-ray spectra that result from 
cascade decays of the primary products of DM annihilation or decay. For illustration we focus here on gamma
rays as final states, and compare in some detail the spectra obtained with \DB\ with those from other codes
as well as analytical expectations.
