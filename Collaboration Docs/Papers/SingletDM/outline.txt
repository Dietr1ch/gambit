GAMBIT physics paper skeleton
=============================

Goal: 'compact' paper with emphasis on results
Essence: the most up-to-date and comprehensive statistical analysis of the model

Introduction

    motivation, literature review, summary of advances in this paper

The physics model(s)

    Lagrangian, parameters, etc. for the particle physics model
    further major physics assumptions (cosmology, astrophysics, etc.)

Likelihood function

    table of observables including name of observable, type of constrain, experimental value(s)/errors [references], theory errors
    description of prediction calculations

Priors

Results

    frequentist: profile likelihoods, p values
    Bayesian: marginalized posteriors, evidences (odds?)
    discussion: comparison to existing results, new results, future prospects
