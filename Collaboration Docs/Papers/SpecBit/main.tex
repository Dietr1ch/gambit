\title{SpecBit: GAMBIT modules for linking and running spectrum genetaors, decay codes and EWPO calculators}

\author{The GAMBIT Collaboration: Alphabetical author list} % will presumably have a standard author list

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present a new code which can link all publically available spectrum generators, decay codes and electroweak precision observable calculators together without writing to any files internally [this may be too ambitious]. Describe novel features, FeynHiggs linking, easy to replace any code. Mention link to GAMBIT framework, but emphasise that the package presents a standalone solution to the problem of linking these codes together and maybe physics problem of matching too FeynHiggs.

\section{Introduction}
motivation, literature review, summary of advances in this paper
%% Wealth of recent LHC data provides strong constraints on new physics models. It remains difficult to apply LHC constraints to generic physics models in a rigorous fashion. Various attempts have been made to automate the process (SmodelS, CheckMATE, etc). No attempt has attacked the problem in a fully rigorous way, and neither have any existing attempts been integrated into a fully general framework for statistical fits of generic BSM theories. 

%% We present a new, fully general solution based on parallelised Monte Carlo simulation, fast detector simulation and fast cross-section calculations for SUSY processes. Part of the Global and Module BSM Inference Tool, which will include, etc. 

%% This paper is organised as follows. In Section ?? we..., etc. 

\section{Physics background}

phenomenology: from Lagrangian to observables

RGEs (statement on purpose, SUSY specific and non-SUSY examples [vacuum stability, gauge coupling unification, Yukawa unification])

spectrum generators for SUSY and non-SUSY models
 
MSSM superpotential etc to lay out conventions (a la SLHA 2)

NMSSM superpotential etc to lay out conventions (a la SLHA 2)

other models:

scalar singlet

 - spectrum issues (Pat \& student)

 - DecayBit

E6SSM

\section{Overview of physics models supported}

MSSM will be most common, just list ones that are fully supported without user modification?

\begin{itemize} 
\item MSSM
  \begin{itemize}
  \item CMSSM 
  \item NUHM 
  \item MSSM-25
  \end{itemize} 
\item NMSSM
  \begin{itemize}
  \item CNMSSM  
  \item NUHNMSSM 
  \item NMSSM-30
  \end{itemize}
\item other models?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item scalar singlet
  \item E6MSSM  
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}  

interfaced spectrum generators (aspirational list)
codes already implemented
         
generator specific BC options for SUSY models

\section{User Interface}

\subsection{Scalar singlet setup} 

[along the line of the MSSM below]

\subsection{MSSM setup} 

interfacing to models already implemented:

SpecBit:

- YAML instructions (input parameter list and values)

- instructions for getters and setters and RGE running
  $get(Pars:Pole_Mass...)$

- specify string names and PDG codes

implementing a new model: MSSMSpec.hpp

default codes 
         (may not want this but softsusy and FS at least 
                         are special to Gambit at some level) 

DecayBit: 

describe decay table and give MSSM examples

interfacing to the decays

adding new codes: more advanced options if user adds own decay code or FeynHiggs alternative
 
multi-threading is default option [check this!]

\subsection{NMSSM setup}

    quick repeat of MSSM but with MSSM specifics


\subsection{Other models}
 
    SUSY

    Non-SUSY


Most of this list from ColliderBit actually applies and should be in stuff above or just below them.
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe interface to GAMBIT framework.
\item Describe standalone interface (how to configure and run the package, what the defaults are).
\item Describe the interface to the models that we include and how to change the input parameters of those models.
\item Explain how to interface with a new model.
\item Explain how to run code in single core or multicore form (i.e using the standard OpenMP commands).
\item Describe parameters that can be varied in yaml file. [included above]
\end{itemize}



\section{Code description}

horrible horrible details:

code structure

\subsection{SpecBit}
\subsection{DeacyBit}
\subsection{EWPOBit}
\subsection{All together now}

%%\subsection{User interface}


\section{Examples}
Give some tutorial-style examples for common use cases.

\subsection{MSSM example}
MSSM run even needed?

adding new MSSM generator (can just use FS example)
\subsection{NMSSM example}
NMSSM run even needed?

adding new NMSSM generator (can just use FS example)
\subsection{exotic SUSY with own tools example - E6SSM?}
May not be possible in time

\section{Outlook}

\section{Conclusions}
Gambit SpecBit,DeacyBayBit and EWPOBit will rule the world.  the rest of gambit is kind of useful too.
