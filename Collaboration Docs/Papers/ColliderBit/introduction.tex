Wealth of recent LHC data provides strong constraints on new physics models. It remains difficult to apply LHC constraints to generic physics models in a rigorous fashion. Various attempts have been made to automate the process (SmodelS, CheckMATE, etc). No attempt has attacked the problem in a fully rigorous way, and neither have any existing attempts been integrated into a fully general framework for statistical fits of generic BSM theories. 

We present a new, fully general solution based on parallelised Monte Carlo simulation, fast detector simulation and fast cross-section calculations for SUSY processes. Part of the Global and Module BSM Inference Tool, which will include, etc. 

This paper is organised as follows. In Section ?? we..., etc.
