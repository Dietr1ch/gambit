Describe the basic design elements of the package, i.e. what we calculate given a model of BSM physics, but with the full details of the calculation deferred to the following section. Need to emphasise that the user may pick and choose each element of the calculation.

\begin{itemize}
\item Number of signal events for cut and count analyses (or in a particular bin of a binned likelihood fit) is $\sigma \times A \times \epsilon \times \mathcal{L}$.
\item State very briefly how each element of the calculation above is performed in ColliderBit.
\item Define likelihoods used in LHC searches based on the signal yields.
\item Describe LEP limit treatment
\end{itemize}
