To build GAMBIT:
  mkdir modules/build
  cd modules/build/
  cmake ..
  make


Issues:

 * The above process may fail to work correctly if files from the
   older build system are still around.  Try clearing out untracked
   project files if you are having problems (see 'git clean').

 * Delphes may fail to build unless the following is performed:
      cd modules/ColliderBit/src/delphes/
      ./make_dicts.sh
   (TODO: do this automatically through cmake)

 * If you have problems compiling FlexibleSUSY/SpecBit and do not
   have need of them, disable them in the cmake command:
       cmake -Ditch="Spec" ..
