To build GAMBIT:
  mkdir modules/build
  cd modules/build/
  cmake ..
  make backends    # If backends not already installed
  make DarkSUSY    # If intending to use DarkBit
  make micromegas  # If intending to use micromegas
  make             # Ordering of make commands is unimportant.
                 

Issues:

 * The above process may fail to work correctly if files from the
   older build system are still around.  Try clearing out untracked
   project files if you are having problems (see 'git clean').

 * Delphes may fail to build unless the following is performed:
      cd modules/ColliderBit/src/delphes/
      ./make_dicts.sh
   (TODO: do this automatically through cmake)

 * If you have problems compiling FlexibleSUSY/SpecBit and do not
   have need of them, disable them in the cmake command:
       cmake -Ditch="Spec" ..

 * The above is a special case of ditching multiple things, which goes as
       cmake -Ditch="foo;bar;etc",
   where *anything* starting with "foo", "bar" or "etc", be it a module,
   backend, scanner, model or test function, will be excluded from
   the compile.

 * In the case the gambit stops complaining about IO errors when opening a
   file in some non-existing path, create the path by hand.
