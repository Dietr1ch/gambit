To build GAMBIT:
  mkdir modules/build
  cd modules/build/
  cmake ..
  make

To choose compilers, change the cmake step to, e.g.
  FC=gfortran CC=gcc CXX=g++ cmake ..

Issues:

 * The above process may fail to work correctly if files from the
   older build system are still around.  Try clearing out untracked
   project files if you are having problems (see 'git clean').

 * Delphes may fail to build unless the following is performed:
      cd modules/ColliderBit/src/delphes/
      ./make_dicts.sh
   (TODO: do this automatically through cmake)

 * If you have problems compiling FlexibleSUSY/SpecBit and do not
   have need of them, disable them in the cmake command:
       cmake -Ditch="Spec" ..

 * If you run the gambit CMake setting gcc as the C++ complier,
   then FlexibleSUSY may fail to find the C++ standard libraries.
   It should work if you set CXX=g++ instead.

 * FlexibleSUSY currently doesn't seem to build under Intel
   compilers. If you try this and it doesn't work, please send
   your cmake and make output to Ben and Peter, along with the
   FlexibleSUSY config.log file 
   (contrib/MassSpectra/flexiblesusy/config.log).
