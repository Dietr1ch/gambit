- finish process catalog:
    - importDecays - which things to include/exclude??
    - particle_database entries - dictionaries -> process catalogue work better?
- python <-> mathematica interface!!
- re-do calchep.py - not good
- check the consistency of the yukawas for SMinputs - 3x3 matrix but accessed like a vector... seems like it wouldn't work?
- spectrum_as_map and fill_as_map as standalone function in SpecBit??
- backend DirectDM (or similar) -> use for Direct Detection etc.
- "includes" function?
- PATH_TO_GAMBIT option
- proper setup.py for installation (setuptools)
- PEP8
- how to incorporate several DM candidates? say, if a model has a scalar and a fermion. 
- merge calchep backend stuff to GUM_development

model hierarchy:
 
  - if no parent -> new spectrum
  - if child to the top of family tree -> new spectrum, rewrite others? hmm.. e.g. inserting 2HDM+S as parent to S? and 2HDM?
