To-do list for GUMMY things, and GAMBIT 2.0.0.

=============
=    GUM    =
=============

* Better termination of code
  * C++ -- as soon as there is an error, call close_wstp_link();
  * Python -- better error throwing

* Model parameters to be obtained (consistently).
  * FeynRules: use common blocks from paramlist?
  * SARAH: ???

* DarkBit:
  * Process Catalogue:
    * importDecays - which things to include/exclude??
    * 2->2 processes for consistency with fermions

* SARAH -> CalcHEP gives lots of zero vertices (e.g. including SUSY mixing matrices for non-SUSY models)
  * Can this be controlled by a useful flag for the output? Or in the model files?
  * If not -> CalcHEP cleaner

* Re-design:
  * calchep.py
  * 2-2 processes/vertex sorters etc. (darkbit)
  * decays.py

* Particle database: automatically add all new particles to particle database.
  * Make this a .gum option? -> "add_new_particles: true"

* Call MadGraph directly from GUM -> Pythia8?
  * Try to intercept logger() -> find correct output

* Model hierarchy:
  * How to consistently define parameter translations?
  * If child goes to the top of family tree -> new spectrum, rewrite others? hmm.. e.g. inserting 2HDM+S as parent to S? and 2HDM?
  * Get rid of "use_existing_spectrum" as its own node, and gain information solely from the translation functions. But still give the user the option to write a new spectrum.
  * Do we NEED to be able to add translation functions? Is this the function of GUM? This is far more trivial from a GAMBIT model hierarchy point of view...

* Option for choice of Lagrangian (potential) basis, or physical basis
  * SARAH: CalculateMasses -> True/False -- should work...

* Create dict of amended files -- to remove duplicates in the stdout of new created files

* If parameters have underscores etc in FeynRules -> yell

* FeynRules -- host externally? Or just pester them. The checksum changes every day...

* Direct detection
  * Need to go from Lagrangian to relativistic coefficients -- some sort of external program..? 
  * Use FeynArts/Calc?
  
* .ufo to .mdl for 4-fermion vertices

==============
=   GAMBIT   =
==============

* Backends
  * CalcHEP
    * Re-design frontend: want an it->externalName() routine for SpectrumParameters.
  * SPheno
    * Check -- is it backended "generally"?
  * Vevacious
  * FlexibleSUSY
    * Needs template BOSS to be truly backended..?
    * Needs additional input to SARAH files?

* Dark Matter:
  * How to incorporate several DM candidates?
    * Multi-component DM e.g. from separate gauge groups
    * When the spectrum determines the LSP?
    * MicroMEGAs 5 allows this...
      * (+ freeze-in)
