To-do list for GUMMY things, and GAMBIT 2.0.0.

=============
=    GUM    =
=============

* Better termination of code
  * C++ -- as soon as there is an error, call close_wstp_link();
  * Python -- better error throwing

* Model parameters to be obtained (consistently).
  * FeynRules: use common blocks from paramlist?
  * SARAH: ???

  * How to extract mass dimension of a parameter?
    * Hopeless from FeynRules since it knows nothing about the dimensionality of the Lagrangian
    * Does SARAH know...? Surely..

* DarkBit:
  * Process Catalogue:
    * importDecays - which things to include/exclude??
    * 2->2 processes for consistency with fermions

* SARAH -> CalcHEP gives lots of zero vertices (e.g. including SUSY mixing matrices for non-SUSY models)
  * Can this be controlled by a useful flag for the output? Or in the model files?
  * If not -> CalcHEP cleaner

* Re-design:
  * calchep.py
  * 2-2 processes/vertex sorters etc. (darkbit)
  * decays.py

* Call MadGraph directly from GUM -> Pythia8?
  * Try to intercept logger() -> find correct output

* Option for choice of Lagrangian (potential) basis, or physical basis
  * SARAH: CalculateMasses -> True/False -- should work...

* Create dict of amended files
  * Remove duplicates in the stdout of new created files
  * Save reset file for each gum run
  * Enable reset mode, i.e. gum -r <reset_file>

* If parameters have underscores etc in FeynRules -> yell

* FeynRules -- host externally? Or just pester them. The checksum changes every day...

* Direct detection
  * Need to go from Lagrangian to relativistic coefficients -- some sort of external program..?
  * Use FeynArts/Calc?

* .ufo to .mdl for 4-fermion vertices



==============
=   GAMBIT   =
==============

* Backends
  * CalcHEP
    * Re-design frontend: want an it->externalName() routine for SpectrumParameters.
  * SPheno
    * Check -- is it backended "generally"?
  * Vevacious
  * FlexibleSUSY
    * Needs template BOSS to be truly backended..?
    * Needs additional input to SARAH files?

* Dark Matter:
  * How to incorporate several DM candidates?
    * Multi-component DM e.g. from separate gauge groups
    * When the spectrum determines the LSP?
    * MicroMEGAs 5 allows this...
      * (+ freeze-in)
