To-do list for GUMMY things, and GAMBIT 2.0.0.

=============
=    GUM    =
=============

* Better termination of code
  * Python -- better error throwing

  * How to extract mass dimension of a parameter?
      * Does SARAH know...? Surely..

* DarkBit:
  * Process Catalogue:
    * 2->2 processes for consistency with fermions

* Option for choice of Lagrangian (potential) basis, or physical basis
  * SARAH: CalculateMasses -> True/False -- should work...

* Things that break FeynRules:
  - If parameters have underscores etc in FeynRules -> yell
  - InteractionOrder not being specified in FeynRules files.
  - particles not having pdg codes

* FeynRules -- host externally? Or just pester them. The checksum changes every day...

* Direct detection
  * Need to go from Lagrangian to relativistic coefficients -- some sort of external program..?
  * Use FeynArts/Calc?

* .ufo to .mdl for 4-fermion vertices

* Generating collider diagrams
  - "Generate all" option?
  - Option to define multiparticles - e.g. for Leptoquark study, "define LQ = u1 u1~ S1 S1~ ..."
  - MadGraph will throw an error if a requested diagram is not available 

* BSM contributions to Standard Model decays (W, Z, etc.) -- do not get added to DecayBit correctly

==============

==============

* Backends
  * FlexibleSUSY
    * Needs template BOSS to be truly backended..?
    * Needs additional input to SARAH files?

* Dark Matter:
  * How to incorporate several DM candidates?
    * Multi-component DM e.g. from separate gauge groups
    * When the spectrum determines the LSP?
    * MicroMEGAs 5 allows this...
      * (+ freeze-in)
