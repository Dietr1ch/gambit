To-do list for GUMMY things, and GAMBIT 2.0.0.

=============
=    GUM    =
=============

* Model parameters to be obtained (consistently).
  * FeynRules: use common blocks from paramlist?
  * SARAH: ???

* DarkBit:
  * Process Catalogue:
    * importDecays - which things to include/exclude??
    * 2->2 processes for consistency with fermions
  * Direct detection: how to automate this? FeynCalc/Arts?
  
* SARAH -> CalcHEP gives lots of zero vertices (e.g. including SUSY mixing matrices for non-SUSY models)
  * Can this be controlled by a useful flag for the output? Or in the model files?
  * If not -> CalcHEP cleaner
  
* Re-design:
  * calchep.py
  * 2-2 processes/vertex sorters etc. (darkbit)
  * decays.py

* Particle database: automatically add all new particles to particle database.
  * Make this a .gum option? -> "add_new_particles: true"

* Call MadGraph directly from GUM -> Pythia8?

* Model hierarchy:
  * How to consistently define parameter translations?
  * If child goes to the top of family tree -> new spectrum, rewrite others? hmm.. e.g. inserting 2HDM+S as parent to S? and 2HDM?
  
* Option for choice of Lagrangian (potential) basis, or physical basis
  * SARAH: CalculateMasses -> True/False -- should work...

==============
=   GAMBIT   =
==============

* Backends
  * CalcHEP
    * Re-design frontend: want an it->externalName() routine for SpectrumParameters.
  * SPheno
    * Check -- is it backended "generally"?
  * DirectDM
  * Vevacious
  * FlexibleSUSY)
    * Needs template BOSS to be truly backended..?

* Dark Matter:
  * How to incorporate several DM candidates? 
    * Multi-component DM e.g. from separate gauge groups 
    * if a model has a scalar and a fermion, and t
    * MicroMEGAs 5 allows this... 
      * (+ freeze-in)
    
* Collider:
  * Is there a "better" way to add new physics to Pythia?
