This is a fork of the findiff package https://github.com/maroba/findiff,
commit 865be17cdb732fc022a063679d0dc9d4454faf2a, modified by Pat Scott
to work with both Python 2.7 and Python 3, for the purposes of the
bao_correlation likelihood. The original package only supports Python 3.
Only the parts used in this likelihood have been verified to work with
Python 2.7.
