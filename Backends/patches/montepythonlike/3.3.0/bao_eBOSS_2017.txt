# Lists measurements from eBOSS DR14 LRGs and QSOs. These overlap with BOSS DR12 and each
# other, but when used with the bao_correlations likleihood, this overlap is computed
# in a cosmology dependent way

# z, quantity, sigma, type (D_V/rs=3, Dv/Mpc=4, DA/rs=5, c/Hrs=6, rs/D_v=7)
# For a given type, the quantity correspond to the listed
