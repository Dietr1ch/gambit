The GAMBIT build system will look to this directory for a DarkSUSY
shared object library ('libdarksusy.so').  However, GAMBIT will not
build this library itself and will simply continue on without the use
of DarkSUSY if the library file is not found.

The easiest way to obtain the DarkSUSY shared object library is to
run:

  ./install_DarkSUSY

This script will download, extract, patch, and compile DarkSUSY as
necessary, though there may be issues on some systems (the build
system is not (yet?) very robust).
