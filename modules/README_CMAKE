CMake is a out-of-source compilation system, i.e. one needs to create a directory for the build step of the compilation
1) mkdir build && cd build

Now we only need to call cmake for configuration and give it the path to the source files, i.e. the location where the main CMakeLists.txt file is located
2) cmake ..

It will check now the dependencies, compilers, etc. If you do not want to use the main C++, C, or Fortran compilers you can set them
2a) CXX=g++-4.9 CC=gcc-4.9 FC=gfortran-4.9 cmake ..

By default, each warning is treated as an error. During development one can turn this feature of with the -DWERROR=OFF switch
2b) cmake .. -DWERROR=OFF

Now you can compile GAMBIT (without ColliderBit for now)
3) make [-j5]

In a seperate step, you can also compile some of the backends, i.e. DDCal0 gamLike DarkSUSY nulike by simply calling the backends target
4) make backends

As usual we have also a clean target
5) make clean

If you need to clean also the cmake created files, just delete the build folder and start from step 1)
6) rm -rf build
