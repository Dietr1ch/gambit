So far, I have only changed the Settings.h and Settings.cc files.
I have only added the ability to have a vector of integers as a 
setting. This should have broken absolutely NOTHING in pythia.

I should probably check that this hack has not broken anything
before I continue..... CHECKED!

The next step is to actually make SUSY:idA and SUSY:idB into
vectors of ints instead of just single ints, and utilize this
within ProcessContainer.... DONE! 

Huh. I guess I'm done... Seems to compile well. Next step is to
test Pythia without using these at all to make sure I didn't break
anything.

Then I need to test using these to make sure that I can really
pick out jut the processes I want.



NOTES:

- Well, I guess I'm a little OCD about my hacks... To keep Pythia
  nice and clean, I decided to make my hack conform to the exisitng
  code structure. Which means that I had to put one tiny line within
  include/PythiaStdlib.h so that the Pythia8 namespace has std::find
- Okay, so I have lists A and B, and particles 1 and 2.
  If B is empty, the situation is easy:
    if !(1 in A or 2 in A) then skip
      ==> if !(1 in A) and !(2 in A) then skip

  If B is full, that must still be true, as well as:
    if !(1 in A) and !(1 in B) then skip
    if !(2 in A) and !(2 in B) then skip
  Unless BOTH 1 and 2 are in A, in which case at least one must be in B:
    if !(1 in B) and !(2 in B) then skip
