So far, I have only changed the Settings.h and Settings.cc files.
I have only added the ability to have a vector of integers as a 
setting. This should have broken absolutely NOTHING in pythia.

I should probably check that this hack has not broken anything
before I continue..... CHECKED!

The next step is to actually make SUSY:idA and SUSY:idB into
vectors of ints instead of just single ints, and utilize this
within ProcessContainer.
