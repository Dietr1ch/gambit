Pythia hack successful. The Pythia options "SUSY:idVectA" and
"SUSY:idVectB" can now be passed in and used to finely control the
process selection. As an example, I have modified Martin's standalone
Pythia code "main41.cc" in the HEColliderBit/standalone directory.

In order to set up the hack, you need to copy some files from the
HEColliderBit/pythiaHacks directory:
1) copy PythiaStdlib.h and Settings.h to
/your/installation/of/pythia/include
2) copy Settings.cc and ProcessContainer.cc to
/your/installation/of/pythia/src
3) sudo copy SUSYProcesses.xml to
/your/installation/of/pythia/xmldoc
4) Then, recompile Pythia.
5) To test my hack, copy main41.cc to
/your/installation/of/pythia/examples
Then go to that directory, "make main41" and "./main41.exe"
