Pythia8 hacks
-------------

The original (successful) hacks were for Pythia 8.176 or so. Equivalents have
now been officially released (although a bit modified) in Pythia 8.180, so no
hacks are now needed. 8.180 also adds several improvements to SUSY modelling,
notably gluino-neutralino processes, so we'd better upgrade for physics reasons,
too.

The Pythia options "SUSY:idVecA" and "SUSY:idVecB" can now be passed in and used
to finely control the process selection. As an example, Abram has modified
Martin's standalone Pythia code "main41.cc" in the HEColliderBit/standalone
directory. To test this, copy main41.cc to /your/builddir/of/pythia/examples.
Then go to that directory, "make main41" and "./main41.exe"
