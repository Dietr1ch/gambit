This directory contains code for running the ATLAS 0 lepton analysis out of the box. It also has the ATLAS analysis conference paper to aid debugging of the ATLAS limit.

main41.cc is a Pythia example, to be built and run in the Pythia "examples" directory. It will require a SLHA file called sps1aWithDecays.spc, and will spit out a hepmc file (if it fails to build, make sure that your makefile is linking to the hepmc libraries).

You can then run the DELPHES code on the hepmc file using DelphesHepMC. This will produce a ROOT file on which you can run the macro ATLAS0Lep.cxx. This can be built with the supplied Makefile.
