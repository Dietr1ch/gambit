Pythia8 OpenMP SUSY generation and analysis demo
================================================

py8-bsm.cc contains a proof-of-concept Pythia8 main program parallelised via OpenMP and
using FastJet and ROOT for a mini final-state particle analysis in the event loop. It
obviously needs to be worked on to make it suitable for inclusion in the Gambit framework
but being so simple makes it obvious what is going on. Build as follows:

g++ py8-bsm.cc -O3 -pedantic -Wall -Wshadow -Wno-long-long -fopenmp \
  `fastjet-config --cxxflags --libs --plugins` `root-config --cflags --libs --ldflags` \
  -I../include -L../lib/archive -lpythia8 -llhapdfdummy \
  -o bin/py8-bsm

The paths on the third line will need to be adapted to point at the Pythia8 installation,
until Pythia8 supplies its own pythia8-config (I'm working on it!)

Run as follows:

PYTHIA8DATA=../xmldoc bin/py8-bsm

or as follows for timing tests with explicit control over the number of threads:

time OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 PYTHIA8DATA=../xmldoc bin/py8-bsm
