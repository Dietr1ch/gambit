GAMBIT HE COLLIDER TODO LIST
============================

* Py8 shower alpha_s -> 0.118

* Parameterising strong subprocess cross-sections
* Huge K-factor tails from Prospino?

* Interpolate subprocess NLO cross-sections
* SUSY subprocesses thread split generalization
* Collate analyses for different subprocesses, with different k-factor weightings
* Convert HEColliderMain to be able to run with/without Delphes/FastSim

* Write more analysis codes!
* Verification of ATLAS limits
* Disabling Py8 model elements => properly populate the Event (direct and via Delphes/FastSim)

* Cleanup collider code... Once class loading is ready, all our code should really be hooked up to Gambit.
- in the meantime, make a Gambit module skeleton ready for our code to hook into
- see if hooking up with Gambit is possible without class loading


* Py8 feedback
- Speeding up SLHA model initialization: perhaps we could multithread to speed this up?
