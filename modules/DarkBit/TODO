DarkBit GAMBIT todo list
------------------------

Write backends for
* DarkSUSY relic density solver
  - Solve problem with fortran vs. C++ array indexing
* Annihilation yields in DarkSUSY
* Lars' p+- propagation codes
* Neutrinos from sun code in DarkSUSY + IceCube
* Direct search codes (Chris' Fortran code)
* Relic density solver of MicrOmegas

Pure GAMBIT code
* Implementation of anti-proton likelihood function (PAMELA)
* Implementation of minimal model (singlet DM?) for prototypical model and
  cross-sectiondefinitions etc.
  - as new Model
  - Calculation of relic density
  - Primitive indirect dwarf limits
  - Direct limits with Chris' module
* Implementation of CMB limits (codes from singlet paper?)
* Primitive dwarf/GC likelihoods
* Make use of print functions, once completed
* Make use error system, once there
