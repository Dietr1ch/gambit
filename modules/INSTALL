Ben: Just a quick file to remind us how to get gambit_example to run :). I am
sure we'll want some similar thing in the end though.

To build GAMBIT:

make -f makefile.g++
or
make -f makefile.icc

To build backend libraries (libfirst.so probably needs to be built on each
system, or else gambit_example will crash when it tries to load it)

libfirst:
Source is in extras/backend_dev/libfirst.cpp

build with:

g++ -fpic -c libfirst.cpp
g++ --shared -o libfirst.so libfirst.o

copy 'libfirst.so' to modules/Backends/lib
