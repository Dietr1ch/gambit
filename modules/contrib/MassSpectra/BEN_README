Instructions for adding new flexiblesusy spectrum generators to gambit:

1. Install flexiblesusy on some computer that has mathematica
2. Follow flexiblesusy README for generating spectrum generator code, using flags to configure for EXPORT
   e.g.
      mylaptop FlexibleSUSY> ./configure --with-models=NUHMSSM --with-install-dir=export_NUHMSSM --disable-compile
      mylaptop FlexibleSUSY> make
      mylaptop FlexibleSUSY> make install-src
   This will copy the new spectrum generator's source code into install-dir.
3. Copy the relevant model dir into the gambit flexiblesusy models folder
   e.g. continuing the above example:
      mylaptop FlexibleSUSY> scp -r export_NUHMSSM/models/NUHMSSM \
         <gambit_install>/GAMBIT/modules/contrib/flexiblesusy/flexiblesusy/models/
   might change some directory names, but hope this idea is clear.
   After this, the contents of flexiblesusy/models should be similar to this:
      gambit_install flexiblesusy> ls flexiblesusy/models/
         CMSSM  NUHMSSM
 
4. Build the spectrum generator code here
      gambit_install flexiblesusy> ./configure --with-models=NUHMSSM
      gambit_install flexiblesusy> make
5. Modify Spectrum object and SpecBit as needed to deal with the new spectrum generator
   (details to come...)

6. NOTE: if you are using the eigen3 installation that is in the gambit extras folder, you will need to add the flag "--with-eigen-incdir=../../../../extras/eigen3" to the configure step.
