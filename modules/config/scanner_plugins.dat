# GAMBIT will parse this file and try to match the entries                  #
# to the models it has registered. If there are any                         #
# conflicts it will report them, and if any models                          #
# are lacking descriptions those will be reported too.                      #
# This is then merged with internally known information                     #

twalk: |
  The twalk sampler is a ensemble MCMC.  Its a multiple chain MCMC that advances 
  each chain by jumping over or away from a current point in another chain.  This
  implementation also mixes in normal "Gaussian" jumps to add variability.  M-H 
  jumps are done on a random lower dimension subspace of the full parameter space.
  The Gelman-Rubin statistic is used as the second moment convergence criterion.  
  
  MCMC inifile options:
    kwalk_ratio (0.9836):      The ratio of kwalk jumps to Gaussian jumps. 
    projection_dimension (4):  The dimension of the space being projected onto.
    gaussian_distance (2.4):   The distance of the Gaussian jump.
    walk_distance: (2.5):      The distance of the kwalk jump over an point.
    transverse_distance (6.0): The distance of the kwalk jumo away from an point.
    chain_number (5+proc_num): The number of MCMC chains.  Default is 5 + number
                               of processes.
    
  Convergence inifile options:
    tolerance (1.01):  The accuracy of the second order moment (1 is perfect).
    cut: (1000):       Number of burn-in points that are not considered.
    
MultiNest: |
  Multinest is a nested sampling algorithm that calculates the evidence and
  explores the posterior.  It continuously updates a random set of "live" points
  by removing the point of lowest likelihood and replaces to with a point of
  greater likelihood.  The Multinest algorithm improves the efficiency by
  encapsulating these live points with ellipsoids.  This implementation uses
  code developed by Feroz et. al.:  http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.3437

  Inifile options:
    IS (1):          do Nested Importance Sampling?
    mmodal (1):      do mode separation?
    ceff (0):        run in constant efficiency mode?
    nlive (1000):    number of live points
    efr (0.8):       set the required efficiency
    tol (0.5):       tol, defines the stopping criteria
    nClsPar (dim):   No. of parameters to do mode separation on. 
                     Default set to parameter dimension.
    updInt (1000):   after how many iterations feedback is required & 
                     the output files should be updated (*10 for dumper)
    Ztol (-1E90):    all the modes with logZ < Ztol are ignored
    maxModes (100):  expected max no. of modes (used only for memory allocation)
    seed (-1):       random no. generator seed, if < 0 then take the seed 
                     from system clock
    fb (1):          need feedback on standard output?
    resume (1):      resume from a previous job?
    outfile (0):     write output files?
    logZero (-1E90): points with loglike < logZero will be ignored by MultiNest
    maxiter (0):     Max no. of iterations, a non-positive value means infinity.
