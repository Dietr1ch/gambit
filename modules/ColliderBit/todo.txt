get rid of 'iter'
'getOptions' from within 'getPythia' should be enough
Anything else which 'getPythia' needs should be a dependency
Allow Gambit to hook up and run the various Pythias in whatever order

See if I can get rid of flags... or pass as dependencies.

Try to statically declare and "reset" subclasses of things...
  - ex. getPythia can simply return a PythiaBase... no need for a pointer
  - no need for things to be new'd
